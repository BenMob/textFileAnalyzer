# textFileAnalyzer
This app analyzes a text file with a (.dat) extension. At run time, the user will have a choice between viewing info
for one letter of the alphabet (A - Z) or viewing info for all letters of the alphabet. 

For each letter of the alphabet, the app will provide:
1)The frequency.
2)The longest word in the file bginning with the letter in question.
3)The shortest word in the file bginning with the letter in question.
All in that order.

Notice: rename the text file as "textFile.dat" before testing.
